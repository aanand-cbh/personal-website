<div className="lead">
  Our current technical interview process is falling short of its purpose. It’s time to reconsider and redesign it to better attract and identify individuals who are not only strong problem solvers, but also demonstrate curiosity, ownership, and a genuine drive to contribute to the growth of both the product and the business.
</div>

This isn't about lowering standards or making interviews easier. It's about recognizing that we're optimizing for the wrong skills and, in the process, missing out on engineers who excel at solving real problems.

## The Great Filter: What We're Actually Testing

Traditional technical interviews—with their focus on algorithmic puzzles, whiteboard coding, and time-pressured problem solving—are excellent at identifying one type of engineer: the puzzle solver. But real engineering work requires problem solvers.

### Who We're Filtering Out

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Who We're Selecting Instead

Meanwhile, our current processes favor:

- **Recent graduates** who just studied algorithms and data structures
- **LeetCode grinders** who have time to memorize hundreds of solutions
- **Performance under pressure** specialists who thrive in artificial interview environments
- **Solution memorizers** who can recite algorithms but struggle with real-world application
- **Greenfield enthusiasts** who've never had to maintain or refactor existing code

## The Reality Gap: What Engineering Actually Looks Like

Real engineering work rarely involves implementing complex algorithms from scratch. Instead, it looks like:

### Debugging Without Clear Answers
- Reading poorly written documentation
- Debugging issues without helpful stack traces
- Working with systems you didn't build and barely understand
- Googling error messages at 2 AM when production is down

### Making Decisions with Incomplete Information
- Refactoring code without breaking existing functionality
- Making architectural trade-offs when you don't have all the data
- Choosing between multiple imperfect solutions
- Balancing technical debt with business requirements

### Working with Real Constraints
- Legacy code that nobody fully understands
- Performance requirements that seem impossible
- Business deadlines that don't align with technical best practices
- Team dynamics and communication challenges

## The Algorithm Fallacy

I've been a software engineer for over 15 years, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've needed to implement a red-black tree. **0**, big fat zero. But I've fixed broken deployments, debugged production issues, and refactored legacy code hundreds of times.

The skills that make someone successful in technical interviews are not the same skills that make someone successful in real engineering work. We're optimizing for puzzle solvers when we need problem solvers.

## What We Should Be Looking For

Instead of focusing on algorithmic complexity, we should prioritize candidates who demonstrate:

### Practical Problem-Solving Skills
- **Can they work with existing code?** Show them a messy codebase and ask how they'd approach improving it
- **Do they understand trade-offs?** Present them with real-world scenarios where there are no perfect solutions
- **Can they debug effectively?** Give them a bug report and see how they approach the investigation

### Communication and Collaboration
- **Do they write clear documentation?** Ask them to explain a technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder
- **Can they work with others?** Include team members in the interview process
- **Do they ask good questions?** Look for candidates who seek to understand context before proposing solutions

### Business Understanding
- **Do they understand the bigger picture?** Ask them to explain how their technical decisions impact business goals
- **Can they prioritize effectively?** Present them with competing requirements and see how they approach prioritization
- **Do they think about long-term implications?** Look for candidates who consider maintenance and scalability

## A Better Interview Process

Here's what a more effective technical interview might look like:

### 1. **Code Review Exercise**
Give candidates a piece of real code (with identifying information removed) and ask them to review it. This tests their ability to:
- Understand unfamiliar code
- Identify potential issues
- Suggest improvements
- Communicate their thoughts clearly

### 2. **System Design Discussion**
Instead of asking them to design a system from scratch, show them an existing system and ask how they'd improve it. This tests:
- Systems thinking
- Understanding of trade-offs
- Ability to work with constraints
- Communication skills

### 3. **Debugging Scenario**
Present them with a real bug report and see how they approach the problem. This tests:
- Problem-solving methodology
- Debugging skills
- Persistence and attention to detail
- Ability to work with incomplete information

### 4. **Team Collaboration**
Include team members in the interview process to assess:
- Communication style
- Ability to work with others
- Knowledge sharing
- Cultural fit

## The Bottom Line

Your interview process is indeed a filter. The question is: are you filtering for the right people?

If you want engineers who can:
- Ship reliable solutions that work
- Write documentation without being asked
- Know when not to build something
- Work effectively with legacy code
- Understand and solve business problems

Then you need to interview for those skills, not for algorithmic puzzle-solving ability.

## Moving Forward

The good news is that many companies are already moving in this direction. Take-home projects, pair programming exercises, and real-world problem discussions are becoming more common. But we still have a long way to go.

As engineering leaders, we have a responsibility to ensure our hiring processes identify the talent we actually need. That means being willing to challenge traditional interview formats and focus on the skills that matter most in real engineering work.

The engineers who will make the biggest impact on your team aren't necessarily the ones who can implement a perfect binary search tree on a whiteboard. They're the ones who can take a messy, broken system and turn it into something that works reliably and can be maintained by the team.

That's the kind of talent we should be filtering for.
