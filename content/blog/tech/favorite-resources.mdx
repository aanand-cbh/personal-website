Over the years, I've collected a number of resources that have been invaluable in my web development journey. In this post, I'll share some of my favorites.

Good documentation is essential for any developer. Here are some of my go-to resources:

- **[React Documentation](https://react.dev)**: Official React docs, recently redesigned and improved
- **[Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)**: Clear and well-structured docs for Next.js

## Tools

The right tools can make a big difference in your development workflow:

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: Essential for version control
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**: Powerful design tool with collaboration features

## Communities

Being part of a community can provide support, inspiration, and opportunities to learn:
