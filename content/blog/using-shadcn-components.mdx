One of the great benefits of using MDX for your blog posts is the ability to include React components directly in your markdown. With our setup, you can use shadcn/ui components right in your blog posts!

## Basic Usage

The standard markdown syntax works as expected:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links to other sites](https://shadcn.com)
- Lists, like the one you're reading now

## Tables with shadcn/ui

Tables are automatically styled using shadcn/ui's Table component:

| Name | Role | Department |
|------|------|------------|
| John Doe | Developer | Engineering |
| Jane Smith | Designer | Design |
| Bob Johnson | Manager | Administration |

## Using Alert Components

You can use the Alert component directly in your MDX:

<Alert>
  This is an important message for your readers!
</Alert>

## Cards for Highlighted Content

Use Card components to highlight important information:

<Card>
  <CardContent>
    This content is displayed in a shadcn/ui Card component, making it stand out from the rest of your blog post.
  </CardContent>
</Card>

## Badges for Categories or Tags

You can use Badge components inline:

This post is about <Badge>shadcn/ui</Badge> and <Badge>MDX</Badge>.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are styled with proper syntax highlighting:

<CodeSnippet 
  language="jsx" 
  code={`function Welcome() {
    return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}`} 
/>

You can also show function components with props:

<CodeSnippet 
  language="jsx" 
  code={`function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}`} 
/>
