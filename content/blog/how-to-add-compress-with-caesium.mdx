## 📦 Caesium

Caesium is a macOS app for compressing images. It is a lightweight and efficient image compressor for .jpg, .png, and .bmp formats. One can download the executable from the official page here: https://saerasoft.com/caesium

## 📦 Caesium CLI

Caesium CLI is a command-line tool for compressing images. It is a lightweight and efficient image compressor for .jpg, .png, and .bmp formats.

Whether you're working with hundreds of images or just want a cleaner way to compress photos from Finder, Caesium CLI is a powerful, lightweight solution. This guide walks you through:

- Installing the Caesium command-line tool
- Moving it to a system-wide directory
- Creating a right-click context menu item in macOS using Automator

This method works on macOS High Sierra to Monterey (and is generally compatible up to Sonoma).

### 🚀 Step 1: Download the Caesium CLI
The Caesium CLI tool, called caesiumclt, is a lightweight and efficient image compressor for .jpg, .png, and .bmp formats.

### 📦 Download from the official source
1. Go to the official Caesium GitHub releases page:

[https://github.com/Lymphatus/caesium-image-compressor/releases](https://github.com/Lymphatus/caesium-image-compressor/releases)

2. Scroll down to the Assets section for the latest release.

3. Download the caesiumclt-macos.zip file.

### 📂 Step 2: Extract and Move `caesiumclt` to a Safe Location
Once downloaded:

1. Unzip the file (double-click on caesiumclt-macos.zip)

2. You'll see a binary file named caesiumclt

Let's move it to a safe, system-wide location so it can be used in any Terminal script.

### 🔐 Move it to /usr/local/bin
1. Open Terminal

2. Run the following command (you'll need your admin password):

```bash
sudo mv ~/Downloads/caesiumclt /usr/local/bin/caesiumclt
```

3. If it's in another folder, adjust the path accordingly.

4. Make it executable:	

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/caesiumclt
```

### ✅ Test the installation
1. Run:

```bash
caesiumclt --help
```

If you see usage instructions, you're good to go!

### 🧰 Step 3: Create a Context Menu Item Using Automator
You can now integrate caesiumclt into Finder using Automator Quick Actions.

### 🪄 Create the Quick Action
1. Open Automator (search Spotlight or go to Applications > Automator)

2. Select New Document → Quick Action

3. Configure the top of the window:

- "Workflow receives current": folders

- In: Finder

### 💡 Add an Shell/Bash script that launches compression
1. Search for and add "Run Shell Script"

2. Drag it into the workflow

3. Replace the default code with:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

caesium_cli_path="/usr/local/bin/caesiumclt"

for folder in "$@"; do
  output_folder="$folder/Compressed"
  mkdir -p "$output_folder"

  find "$folder" -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" -o -iname "*.png" \) | while read -r img; do
    "$caesium_cli_path" -q 80 -o "$output_folder" "$img"
  done

  open "$output_folder"
done
```

### 💾 Save the Quick Action
1. Go to File > Save

2. Name it: Compress with Caesium

Now, this action will appear when you right-click on a folder in Finder!

### 🧪 Using It
1. In Finder, right-click any folder containing images

2. Choose Quick Actions > Compress with Caesium

A Terminal window will open and show:

- Compression progress for each image

- A message when finished

3. The compressed files in a new Compressed/ subfolder

### 🧹 Cleaning Up or Uninstalling
To delete the Quick Action:

1. Go to Finder → Press Shift + Command + G

2. Enter: ~/Library/Services

Delete the file: Compress with Caesium.workflow

### ✅ Final Notes
This method works without needing Xcode or advanced scripting tools.

- You can customize the compression quality (-q) in the script above.

- Works well on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
