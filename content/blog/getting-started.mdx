Building a personal website is a rewarding experience. It gives you a place to showcase your work, share your thoughts, and connect with others. In this post, I'll share how I built this website and what I learned along the way.

## Why I Built This Website

I wanted a place to collect useful resources I've found and share my thoughts on various topics. A personal website seemed like the perfect solution.

## The Technology Stack

I chose Next.js for this website because it offers a great developer experience and excellent performance. Combined with Tailwind CSS for styling, it's a powerful combination for building modern websites.

Here's a simple code example of a React component:

<CodeSnippet 
  language="jsx" 
  code={`function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}`} 
/>

## What I Learned

Building this website taught me a lot about web development, design, and content creation. I learned how to:

- Structure a website for optimal user experience
- Make it responsive for all device sizes
- Optimize it for performance and SEO
- Write content that engages readers

## Next Steps

I plan to continue adding to this website, both in terms of content and functionality. Some features I'm considering:

1. A newsletter for subscribers
2. A search function for blog posts
3. A comments section for discussions
4. Integration with social media platforms

I'm excited to see how this site evolves over time and hope it becomes a valuable resource for others.
