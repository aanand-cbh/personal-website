Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. In this post, I'll share my experience learning and using Next.js.

## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js for several reasons:

- **Server-side rendering**: Improves performance and SEO
- **File-based routing**: Simplifies navigation structure
- **API routes**: Makes it easy to create backend functionality
- **Image optimization**: Automatically optimizes images for performance
- **Great developer experience**: Hot reloading, error reporting, etc.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward. The documentation is excellent, and there are many tutorials and courses available.

I started with the official tutorial on the Next.js website, which walks you through building a simple blog. This gave me a good understanding of the basics.

## Features I Love

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses the file system for routing, which makes it intuitive to create new pages:

```
pages/
  index.js         // -> /
  about.js         // -> /about
  blog/
    index.js       // -> /blog
    [slug].js      // -> /blog/:slug
```

### 2. Server Components

With the App Router, Next.js introduced React Server Components, which allow you to render components on the server:

<CodeSnippet 
  language="jsx" 
  code={`// This component renders on the server
export default function ServerComponent() {
    return <div>I'm rendered on the server!</div>;
}`} 
/>

### 3. Data Fetching

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data, including `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and now with the App Router, async/await in Server Components:

<CodeSnippet 
  language="jsx" 
  code={`async function getData() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
    return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}`} 
/>

## Challenges

Like any technology, Next.js has its challenges:

- Understanding the different rendering strategies and when to use each one
- Learning the App Router after being familiar with the Pages Router
- Dealing with hydration errors when mixing client and server components

## Conclusion

Overall, I've had a positive experience learning and using Next.js. It's a powerful tool that I'll continue to use for future projects. If you're considering learning Next.js, I highly recommend it!
