# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
As of July 18th, 2025, the primary focus is on:

1. **Blog System Enhancement**: Recently completed major categorization overhaul with tier system
2. **File Structure Optimization**: Implemented category-based file organization 
3. **Content Classification**: Reference/revisit/read tier system with reusable utilities
4. **Documentation**: Maintaining comprehensive memory bank system

## Recent Changes

### Major Implementation: File Structure Reorganization
**Completed**: Category-based file organization matching URL structure

**Key Changes**:
- Reorganized content from `content/blog/*.mdx` to `content/blog/{category}/*.mdx`
- Updated MDX loading logic to traverse category directories
- Created dedicated folders: `tech/`, `travel/`, `spiritual/`, `personal/`
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving organization

**Benefits Achieved**:
- File structure matches URL structure (`/blog/tech/` â†’ `content/blog/tech/`)
- Easier content management and organization
- Clear separation of content by category
- Scalable structure for future content growth

### Major Implementation: Tier System with Reusable Utilities
**Completed**: Reference/revisit/read classification with centralized components

**Key Changes**:
- Replaced essential/valuable/general with reference/revisit/read tiers
- Created reusable `components/blog-utils.tsx` with `getTierBadge()` function
- Added tier filtering buttons to category pages with appropriate icons
- Implemented smart sorting by tier priority then date
- Updated all blog post frontmatter with tier classifications

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Action-oriented tier naming that reflects usage patterns
- Eliminated code duplication across all blog pages
- Consistent tier badge styling and behavior
- URL-based tier filtering with clear user feedback

### Performance Fixes
**Hydration Error Resolution**:
- Fixed breadcrumbs component using inconsistent `baseUrl` generation
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to body tag for browser extension compatibility
- Cleaned up verbose console logging in MDX processing

**About Page Simplification**:
- Removed "Connect With Me" section and resume button
- Removed placeholder profile image
- Converted to centered single-column layout for better focus

### Content Creation
**New Blog Post**: "Understanding React Hydration Errors"
- Comprehensive technical guide with practical examples
- Uses real-world scenarios from recent fixes
- Incorporates shadcn/ui components for enhanced presentation
- Published July 18th, 2025

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Philosophy
- **Content-First Approach**: Prioritizing valuable content over flashy features
- **Performance Over Features**: Every addition must justify its performance impact
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring all components meet accessibility standards
- **Maintainability**: Code patterns that scale with content growth

### Component Architecture
- **Reusability**: Prefer components that eliminate duplication (see CategoryBlogPage success)
- **Server Components**: Default to server components, only use client when necessary
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing throughout

### Content Strategy
- **Quality over Quantity**: Well-researched, practical content
- **Evergreen Focus**: Content that remains valuable over time
- **Real-World Examples**: Drawing from actual development experiences

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Test New Blog Post**: Verify hydration blog post renders correctly in all categories
2. **Memory Bank Completion**: Finish populating all memory bank files
3. **Content Review**: Ensure all existing posts display properly with new system

### Short Term (Next Few Days)
1. **Content Expansion**: Create more category-specific content
2. **SEO Optimization**: Review and enhance meta tags and structured data
3. **Performance Audit**: Run Lighthouse tests on new categorization system

### Medium Term (Next Few Weeks)
1. **Search Enhancement**: Consider server-side search for better performance at scale
2. **Analytics Setup**: Configure detailed analytics for category performance
3. **Content Calendar**: Establish regular publishing schedule

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Directory Structure**: Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- **Component Props**: Always define TypeScript interfaces for component props

### Content Management
- **Frontmatter Schema**: Strict typing with required fields (title, date, description, category)
- **Image Handling**: Use Next.js Image component with proper optimization
- **SEO**: Every page must have proper meta tags and structured data

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Components should handle missing data gracefully
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and loading states
- **Development Debugging**: Detailed error information in development mode

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Successful Patterns
1. **Reusable Components**: CategoryBlogPage demonstrated massive value in reducing duplication
2. **Category-Scoped Search**: Users prefer focused search within specific content types
3. **MDX with Components**: Rich content presentation significantly improves engagement
4. **Static Generation**: Performance benefits are substantial for content-heavy sites

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Search Scalability**: Current client-side search may need server-side solution as content grows
2. **Category Management**: Consider dynamic category creation vs hardcoded categories
3. **Content Discovery**: May need better cross-category content recommendations

### Technical Insights
1. **Hydration Issues**: Browser extensions are a common source of hydration mismatches
2. **Performance Impact**: Every client component should justify its necessity
3. **SEO Value**: Proper structured data significantly improves search visibility

## Current Development Environment
- **Date Context**: July 18th, 2025 [[memory:3637544]]
- **Next.js Version**: 15.2.4 (latest stable)
- **Build Status**: All systems operational, no blocking issues
- **Performance**: Meeting all Core Web Vitals requirements

## Stakeholder Communication
- **Content Strategy**: Focus on technical depth with practical applicability
- **Feature Requests**: Evaluate all new features against performance and maintenance impact
- **User Feedback**: Monitor analytics for category usage patterns to guide future development
