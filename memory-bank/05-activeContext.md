### Performance Fixes
**Hydration Error Resolution**:
- Fixed breadcrumbs component using inconsistent `baseUrl` generation
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to body tag for browser extension compatibility
- Cleaned up verbose console logging in MDX processing

**Accordion Component Fix**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Accordion component had custom hash-based state management causing client-side rendering issues
- **Server vs Client Rendering**: Collapsible components work in server-side rendering, Accordion components failed in client-side rendering
- **Solution Applied**: Removed custom `window.location.hash` state management from accordion component

**MDX Nested Paragraph Error Fix** (July 24, 2025):
- **Root Cause**: MDX automatically wraps content in `<p>` tags, causing hydration errors when using `<p>` tags inside components
- **Error Pattern**: `In HTML, <p> cannot be a descendant of <p>. This will cause a hydration error.`
- **Solution Applied**: Replaced all `<p>` tags with `<div>` tags in MDX content while maintaining same styling
- **Components Fixed**: TooltipContent, HoverCardContent, CardContent paragraphs, grid card content
- **Prevention**: Added comprehensive pattern to systemPatterns.md for future reference
- **Status**: Resolved - blog post now builds without hydration errors

**Blog Post Creation Protocol Implementation** (July 24, 2025):
- **MANDATORY PROCESS**: Created comprehensive 4-step protocol for all new blog posts
- **Step 1**: UI Component Analysis - List and inspect all available components before writing
- **Step 2**: SEO and Metadata Implementation - Complete frontmatter with all required fields
- **Step 3**: Client-Side Component Detection - Add `clientSide: true` for interactive components
- **Step 4**: Content Quality Checklist - 10-point verification process
- **Benefits**: Ensures consistent quality, SEO optimization, and optimal UI/UX without reminders
- **Status**: Documented in systemPatterns.md as mandatory protocol
- **Result**: Reverted to standard Radix UI accordion behavior for proper SSR and client-side compatibility
- **Testing**: Both server-side (Oprah blog) and client-side (cursor memory bank) accordion components now work correctly

**Accordion Value Issue Resolution**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Using `value="context-extensions"` on Accordion root with `type="single"` creates controlled component conflict
- **Problem**: When using `type="single"` with `collapsible`, setting `value` on root makes it controlled, but without proper state management
- **Solution Applied**: Removed `value` prop from Accordion root, allowing it to be uncontrolled component
- **Alternative Solution**: Use `defaultValue` instead of `value` for initial state without controlled behavior
- **Result**: Accordion components now work correctly without hydration mismatches

**Enhanced Hydration Mismatch Fix**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Browser extensions (like Clutter Free) adding CSS classes to DOM elements before React hydration
- **Problem**: Classes like `cf_div_theme_dark` causing server/client HTML mismatch in HoverCard and Link components
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Enhanced browser extension prevention script in layout.tsx with more aggressive className setter override
  - Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to CustomLink component in mdx-client.tsx
  - Enhanced HoverCard components with suppressHydrationWarning
  - Added suppressHydrationWarning to all Card components (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, etc.)
  - Added suppressHydrationWarning to Badge component
  - Implemented MutationObserver to monitor and clean new elements
  - Added multiple cleanup intervals (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000ms) to catch all modifications
- **Result**: Comprehensive protection against browser extension interference during hydration
- **Components Updated**:
  - `components/ui/hover-card.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to HoverCardTrigger and HoverCardContent
  - `components/ui/card.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to all Card components
  - `components/ui/badge.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to Badge component
  - `components/mdx-client.tsx` - Enhanced CustomLink with suppressHydrationWarning
- **Files Updated**:
  - `app/layout.tsx` - Enhanced browser extension prevention with className setter override and MutationObserver

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Philosophy
- **Content-First Approach**: Prioritizing valuable content over flashy features
- **Performance Over Features**: Every addition must justify its performance impact
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring all components meet accessibility standards
- **Maintainability**: Code patterns that scale with content growth

### Component Architecture
- **Reusability**: Prefer components that eliminate duplication (see CategoryBlogPage success)
- **Server Components**: Default to server components, only use client when necessary
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing throughout

### Content Strategy
- **Quality over Quantity**: Well-researched, practical content
- **Evergreen Focus**: Content that remains valuable over time
- **Real-World Examples**: Drawing from actual development experiences
- **SEO Excellence**: Every blog post must include comprehensive SEO metadata for optimal search visibility

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Test New Blog Post**: Verify hydration blog post renders correctly in all categories
2. **Memory Bank Completion**: Finish populating all memory bank files
3. **Content Review**: Ensure all existing posts display properly with new system

### Short Term (Next Few Days)
1. **Content Expansion**: Create more category-specific content
2. **SEO Optimization**: Review and enhance meta tags and structured data
3. **Performance Audit**: Run Lighthouse tests on new categorization system

### Medium Term (Next Few Weeks)
1. **Search Enhancement**: Consider server-side search for better performance at scale
2. **Analytics Setup**: Configure detailed analytics for category performance
3. **Content Calendar**: Establish regular publishing schedule

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Directory Structure**: Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- **Component Props**: Always define TypeScript interfaces for component props

### Content Management
- **Frontmatter Schema**: Strict typing with required fields (title, date, description, category)
- **Image Handling**: Use Next.js Image component with proper optimization
- **SEO**: Every page must have proper meta tags and structured data
- **Blog Post SEO**: Every new blog post MUST include comprehensive SEO metadata (see systemPatterns.md 4.1)
- **Johnny.Decimal Naming**: All new blog posts MUST follow Johnny.Decimal naming convention (see systemPatterns.md 4.0)

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Components should handle missing data gracefully
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and loading states
- **Development Debugging**: Detailed error information in development mode

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Successful Patterns
1. **Reusable Components**: CategoryBlogPage demonstrated massive value in reducing duplication
2. **Category-Scoped Search**: Users prefer focused search within specific content types
3. **MDX with Components**: Rich content presentation significantly improves engagement
4. **Static Generation**: Performance benefits are substantial for content-heavy sites

### Areas for Improvement
