- Better mobile experience with responsive layouts
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with modern design patterns
- Faster information consumption without excessive clicking
- Maintained all interactive functionality where beneficial

### Major Implementation: File Structure Reorganization
**Completed**: Category-based file organization matching URL structure

**Key Changes**:
- Reorganized content from `content/blog/*.mdx` to `content/blog/{category}/*.mdx`
- Updated MDX loading logic to traverse category directories
- Created dedicated folders: `tech/`, `travel/`, `spiritual/`, `personal/`
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving organization

**Benefits Achieved**:
- File structure matches URL structure (`/blog/tech/` â†’ `content/blog/tech/`)
- Easier content management and organization
- Clear separation of content by category
- Scalable structure for future content growth

### Major Implementation: Tier System with Reusable Utilities
**Completed**: Reference/revisit/read classification with centralized components

**Key Changes**:
- Replaced essential/valuable/general with reference/revisit/read tiers
- Created reusable `components/blog-utils.tsx` with `getTierBadge()` function
- Added tier filtering buttons to category pages with appropriate icons
- Implemented smart sorting by tier priority then date
- Updated all blog post frontmatter with tier classifications

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Action-oriented tier naming that reflects usage patterns
- Eliminated code duplication across all blog pages
- Consistent tier badge styling and behavior
- URL-based tier filtering with clear user feedback

### Performance Fixes
**Hydration Error Resolution**:
- Fixed breadcrumbs component using inconsistent `baseUrl` generation
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to body tag for browser extension compatibility
- Cleaned up verbose console logging in MDX processing

**Accordion Component Fix**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Accordion component had custom hash-based state management causing client-side rendering issues
- **Server vs Client Rendering**: Collapsible components work in server-side rendering, Accordion components failed in client-side rendering
- **Solution Applied**: Removed custom `window.location.hash` state management from accordion component
- **Result**: Reverted to standard Radix UI accordion behavior for proper SSR and client-side compatibility
- **Testing**: Both server-side (Oprah blog) and client-side (cursor memory bank) accordion components now work correctly

**Accordion Value Issue Resolution**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Using `value="context-extensions"` on Accordion root with `type="single"` creates controlled component conflict
- **Problem**: When using `type="single"` with `collapsible`, setting `value` on root makes it controlled, but without proper state management
- **Solution Applied**: Removed `value` prop from Accordion root, allowing it to be uncontrolled component
- **Alternative Solution**: Use `defaultValue` instead of `value` for initial state without controlled behavior
- **Result**: Accordion components now work correctly without hydration mismatches

**Enhanced Hydration Mismatch Fix**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Browser extensions (like Clutter Free) adding CSS classes to DOM elements before React hydration
- **Problem**: Classes like `cf_div_theme_dark` causing server/client HTML mismatch in HoverCard and Link components
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Enhanced browser extension prevention script in layout.tsx with more aggressive className setter override
  - Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to CustomLink component in mdx-client.tsx
  - Enhanced HoverCard components with suppressHydrationWarning
  - Added suppressHydrationWarning to all Card components (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, etc.)
  - Added suppressHydrationWarning to Badge component
  - Implemented MutationObserver to monitor and clean new elements
  - Added multiple cleanup intervals (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000ms) to catch all modifications
- **Result**: Comprehensive protection against browser extension interference during hydration
- **Components Updated**:
  - `components/ui/hover-card.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to HoverCardTrigger and HoverCardContent
  - `components/ui/card.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to all Card components
  - `components/ui/badge.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to Badge component
  - `components/mdx-client.tsx` - Enhanced CustomLink with suppressHydrationWarning
- **Files Updated**:
  - `app/layout.tsx` - Enhanced browser extension prevention with className setter override and MutationObserver

**About Page Simplification**:
- Removed "Connect With Me" section and resume button
- Removed placeholder profile image
- Converted to centered single-column layout for better focus

### Content Creation
**New Blog Post**: "Understanding React Hydration Errors"
- Comprehensive technical guide with practical examples
- Uses real-world scenarios from recent fixes
