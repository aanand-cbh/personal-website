# Memory Bank - Personal Website Project

This Memory Bank serves as the comprehensive documentation system for the personal website project. After each session reset, all memory bank files must be read to understand the project context and continue work effectively.

## File Hierarchy and Dependencies

```
01-projectbrief.md (Foundation)
├── 02-productContext.md (Why & How)
├── 03-systemPatterns.md (Technical Architecture)  
└── 04-techContext.md (Technology Stack)
    └── 05-activeContext.md (Current State)
        └── 06-progress.md (Status & Tracking)
```

## Date Tracking (Required - 00)

### 0. 00-current-date.md
**Purpose**: Current session date and tracking protocol  
**Contains**: Current date, usage instructions, date format, recent updates  
**Read First**: Update this date at the start of each new session

## Core Files (Read in Order)

### 1. 01-projectbrief.md
**Purpose**: Foundation document defining project scope and goals  
**Contains**: Project overview, core goals, target audience, key features, success metrics, constraints  
**Read First**: This shapes understanding of all other files

### 2. 02-productContext.md  
**Purpose**: Product vision and user experience strategy  
**Contains**: Problem statement, solution vision, user personas, content philosophy  
**Dependencies**: Built upon 01-projectbrief.md foundations

### 3. 03-systemPatterns.md
**Purpose**: Technical architecture and design patterns  
**Contains**: Architecture overview, design patterns, component patterns, data flow  
**Dependencies**: Implements goals from 01-projectbrief.md

### 4. 04-techContext.md
**Purpose**: Technology stack and technical constraints  
**Contains**: Tech stack, development setup, dependencies, build process, performance optimizations  
**Dependencies**: Supports architecture from 03-systemPatterns.md

### 5. 05-activeContext.md
**Purpose**: Current work focus and recent changes  
**Contains**: Current work focus, recent changes, active decisions, next steps, learnings  
**Dependencies**: Builds upon all foundation files  
**Critical**: This tracks the current state and must be updated frequently

### 6. 06-progress.md
**Purpose**: Project status and evolution tracking  
**Contains**: What works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, achievements  
**Dependencies**: Reflects progress toward goals defined in other files  
**Critical**: Must be updated after significant changes

### 7. 07-johnny-decimal-naming-guide.md (Reference)
**Purpose**: Quick reference for blog post naming convention  
**Contains**: Category IDs, naming format, current post counts, next available IDs  
**Usage**: Reference when creating new blog posts to maintain IDE organization

## Usage Guidelines

### For New Sessions
1. **Update Current Date** - Run `npm run update-date` to automatically update all date references
2. **Read ALL files** - Memory resets completely between sessions
3. **Start with 01-projectbrief.md** - Establishes foundation understanding
4. **Read in numerical order** - Each file builds upon previous ones (01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06)
5. **Pay special attention to 05-activeContext.md** - Contains current state
6. **Check 06-progress.md** - Understand what's working and what needs work

### Self-Verification System
Each memory bank file contains its own verification section with specific questions I must be able to answer after reading that file. This ensures I have complete context before proceeding with any task.

### Memory Bank Reading Protocol
**CRITICAL**: I must update the current date (00-current-date.md) and read ALL numbered files (01-06) in order before starting any task. Each file contains reminders to read the other files, creating a self-reinforcing system.

### For Updates
- **05-activeContext.md**: Update after any significant changes or new insights
- **06-progress.md**: Update after completing features or reaching milestones  
- **Other files**: Update when core patterns or technologies change

### Update Triggers
- Discovering new project patterns
- After implementing significant changes
- When user requests "update memory bank"
- When context needs clarification
- After major architectural decisions

## Current Project State (August 04, 2025)

### Status: ✅ Fully Operational
- **Core Systems**: Blog categorization, search, SEO all working
- **Recent Major Changes**: Complete blog categorization overhaul with reusable components
- **Current Focus**: Content creation and performance optimization
- **Next Steps**: Memory bank testing and content expansion

### Key Achievements
- 75% code reduction through CategoryBlogPage component
- Complete hydration error resolution
- Comprehensive technical blog post published
- Memory bank documentation system established

## Maintenance Notes

### File Relationships
- Changes to 01-projectbrief.md may require updates to all dependent files
- 05-activeContext.md and 06-progress.md should be updated most frequently
- 03-systemPatterns.md changes when architectural decisions are made
- 04-techContext.md updates when technology choices change

### Quality Standards
- All files must be comprehensive enough to restore full project context
- Technical details should be specific and actionable
- Recent changes must be documented with sufficient detail
- Next steps should be clear and prioritized

---

**Remember**: This Memory Bank is the only persistent knowledge across sessions. Its accuracy and completeness directly impact development effectiveness.

## Verification Protocol

### Before Starting Any Task
1. Read ALL memory bank files in numerical order
2. Answer the self-verification questions above
3. If any questions cannot be answered confidently, re-read the relevant files
4. Only proceed with the task when all context is clear

### Quality Assurance
- The memory bank must be comprehensive enough to restore full project context
- Technical details should be specific and actionable
- Recent changes must be documented with sufficient detail
- Next steps should be clear and prioritized
